            Hi, I&apos;m Eric.<br />I&apos;m a product leader and curious builder who loves solving tricky problems and creating things that make life better. <br />I believe the best solutions come from listening deeply, asking thoughtful questions, and not being afraid to try (and fail at) something new.
Over the years, I&apos;ve learned that great teams are built on trust, creativity thrives with collaboration, and success often hides in the small, unglamorous steps along the way. <br />Outside of work, I&apos;m a dad, a tinkerer, and someone who&apos;s endlessly fascinated by how technology can reshape the world in surprising ways.
If that sounds like your vibe, let&apos;s connectâ€”I&apos;m always up for the next great challenge.
