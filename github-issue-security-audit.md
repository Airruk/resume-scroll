# User Story

**Title**: Audit and Secure Environment Variable Management

As a **security-conscious developer**
I want **to audit and improve environment variable security practices in the resume-scroll application**
So that **sensitive API keys and secrets are never exposed in the repository or compromised**

## Context
- Links: [Next.js Environment Variables Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables)
- Non-functional requirements:
  - No secrets should ever be committed to the repository
  - Production and development environments should use different credentials
  - Environment variables should follow principle of least privilege
  - Must comply with security best practices for API key management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Repository Security Audit
Given the repository contains environment files
When I perform a security audit of the codebase
Then no real API keys or secrets should be found in committed files
And all environment files containing secrets should be properly gitignored
And git history should not contain any exposed credentials

### Scenario 2: Environment File Structure
Given the application uses environment variables
When I examine the environment file structure
Then there should be a clear separation between template files and actual secrets
And `.env.example` should contain only placeholder values
And actual environment files should be excluded from version control

### Scenario 3: Secret Classification
Given the application uses various API keys and configuration
When I review environment variables
Then public variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_*) should be clearly identified
And private server-side variables should be properly secured
And each variable should have appropriate access controls

### Scenario 4: Production Deployment Security
Given the application is deployed to production
When environment variables are configured
Then production secrets should be managed through deployment platform
And development/staging/production should use separate credentials
And there should be no hardcoded secrets in the codebase

## Security Checklist

### Immediate Actions Required
- [ ] Audit git history for any committed secrets
- [ ] Rotate any potentially exposed API keys
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` properly excludes all environment files
- [ ] Remove any real secrets from local environment files in repo

### Environment File Improvements
- [ ] Update `.env.example` with clear placeholder values
- [ ] Document environment variable requirements in README
- [ ] Implement proper file naming conventions
- [ ] Add comments explaining public vs private variables

### Deployment Security
- [ ] Configure environment variables in deployment platform
- [ ] Implement separate credentials for each environment
- [ ] Document secret rotation procedures
- [ ] Set up monitoring for credential usage

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Use deployment platform environment variable settings (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- Implement environment-specific configuration
- Consider using secret management services for production
- Add validation for required environment variables

## Definition of Done
- [ ] No secrets present in git repository or history
- [ ] All sensitive API keys rotated if previously exposed
- [ ] Proper `.gitignore` configuration verified
- [ ] Environment file structure follows security best practices
- [ ] Production deployment uses platform-managed secrets
- [ ] Documentation updated with security guidelines
- [ ] Security audit checklist completed and verified
